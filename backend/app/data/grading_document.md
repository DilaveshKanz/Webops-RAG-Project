Student has to complete the OPPE System Compatibility Test (SCT) exam

SoP for the SCT Exam is as follows: [Click Here for OPPE SCT SoP Document](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTdav-7UPZozRpna9urZkBmB55ldbfJeUFTRYDMbgEpzdt5rSId3tm0zKKjbTAMLYj49hWwqb9jM0Ca/pub&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1764874104072590&usg=AOvVaw32FGxseR9yomaqBTgsegDo)

OPPE1 will not be scheduled for students who fail to complete the OPPE SCT exam.

Eligibility to appear for the OPPE 2:

Most courses have eligibility criteria to attend the final exam.

In case you do not become eligible to write the final exam, OPPE2 will also not be scheduled for you as you will be awarded WA/WQ grade and anyway have to repeat the entire course the next time including all assessment components.

In addition, Python, PDSA and Java have criteria based on GrPA scores of weeks 1-8 to be eligible to appear for the OPPEs. Please check the grading formula for these courses for more details.

*TDS has a Remote Online Exam (ROE), which is a non-proctored , open internet exam. No SCT is required for TDS.

We might have additional dates for OPPEs depending on the number of students who register for courses with OPPEs. These dates could be any date and timing of OPPE week.

# Bonus Marks

Bonus Marks are for encouraging and incentivising the students to participate more in the activities of the course.

These marks will be added ONLY for the students who pass the course and will only impact the course grade, and not the pass criteria . Criteria for bonus marks:

Marks will be applicable based on availability of mock activities in the course. It can vary from course to course and can range from 0-2.

- If the average of the marks obtained in all themock tests conducted before Quiz 1 & Quiz 2 >= 40/100, students will get 2 marks. The mock tests have to be done within the time specified.
- The course team may set upadditional activities in the course which will be eligible for upto 3 bonus marks. If no additional activities are set up, this bonus won't be applicable.

Participation in the discourse forum: Badges

We will be looking at active engagement with Discourse in a term and provide badges for participation.

Badges will be given based on the number of hours a student spends on Discourse. A student is expected to spend a minimum of 1 hour per week per course in Discourse reading posts.

Student will get the following badges:

Read time of upto 4 hours per course in a term: Badge 1

(Applicable only after you get the BS student roll number)

# Information about course grades:

S,A,B,C,D,E - Pass grade; U/WA/WQ - Fail grade   I - Incomplete

In I grade - there are 3 types:

1. If you are absent for ET alone but all other assessment components are completed (quizzes, OPPEs, project, weekly assignments) - grade will be pushed as I.

Options: You can register to take up ET exam alone in the subsequent term. OPPE and quizzes will not be scheduled for you. All other marks for Final course score will be taken from the previous run. The fee will be charged only for end term exam.

OR

You can choose to repeat the entire course paying the full course fees.

1. If you have failed in the OPPE but wrote the ET exam and crossed the cutoff for T as given in the course grading policy, grade = I_OP.

You can register to do the OPPE alone whereby if the course has one OPPE, that will be scheduled. If the course has 2 OPPEs, both will be scheduled for you. You can attempt the OPPE alone. All other mark components of FInal course score will be taken from the previous run. ET and quizzes will not be scheduled for you.

1. If you have failed in the OPPE and absent for ET, then grade = I_BOTH

You can register to ET and OPPEs alone. If the course has one OPPE, that will be scheduled. If the course has 2 OPPEs, both will be scheduled for you. You will attempt the ET and OPPEs. Quiz and GAA and other components will be taken from the previous run and not scheduled.

In all the above cases, you can also choose to Repeat the entire course and not just do the ET/OPPE alone if you want to reattempt all assessment components.

# Suggested pathway to register and study Foundation level courses:

For those entering Foundation Level in MAY 2024 or after, kindly go through the new rules: 4/6/8 courses to be completed in 4/6/9 terms. Else you will be removed from the program.

Academic policies:

1. In each programming assignment, be it any course or any OPPE,  taking help from LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini) partially or completely is considered plagiarism.

2. Unless explicitly permitted, do not use LLMs. Using LLMs is considered a violation of honour code.

3. Students can discuss and learn from each other but the assignments are expected to be done individually based on their understanding.

# Diploma Level courses

## Suggested pathway to register and study Diploma level courses:

1. Most aggressive pathway - completing in 4 terms- ONLY IF YOU ARE DOING THIS AS FULL TIME AND NOTHING ELSE AND CAN SPEND70 HRs PER WEEKMINIMUM
2. Comfortable pathway - 6 terms - 2 years: Suggested for students and working professionals doing this along with another degree or their job (40hrs/week)
3. Those from non technical backgrounds, new to programming or have busy schedules, recommended to take 6 or 7 terms for the 2 diplomas.
4. Same sequence of courses are suggested if you are taking only the Diploma in programming or Diploma in DS separately too.

Maximum number of terms to complete both Diplomas: 12

Even with a relaxed pathway, you should complete in a maximum of 7 or 8 terms.

The new rules for those entering Diploma Level from May 2024 onwards:

- Complete minimum of 3 courses and 1 project in every 3 terms, which means the

- Theslowest you can go is 3 courses and 1 project in 3 terms (1 year), 6 courses and 2 projects in 6 terms (2 years), 9 courses and 3 projects in 9 terms (3 years) and 12 courses and 4 projects in 12 terms (4 years).

- At the end of 3 terms, if you do not complete 3 courses and 1 project you will be given warning.
- At the end of 6/9/12 terms if you do not complete 6/9/12 courses and 2/3/4 projects, you will be removed from the program.

If you wish to do the Diploma in programming and Diploma in data science one after the other and not mix up the courses, here are the suggested pathways.

IMPORTANT

1. OPPEs for all Diploma courses will be scheduled in the following way:

1. If you have 2 courses with OPPEs, both will be scheduled on 07th Dec                                .
2. If you have 3 courses with OPPEs, OPPEs for 2 courses will be scheduled on 7th Dec  and OPPE for 1 course will be scheduled on 14th Dec                                                                        .
3. If you have 4 courses with OPPEs, OPPEs for 2 courses will be scheduled on  7th Dec and OPPE for the other 2 courses will be scheduled on 14th Dec

In the cases of b and c above, if you fail or are absent in subjects of 7 th Dec and are rescheduled for 14th Dec , there will be no option to split the subjects any further or reschedule them. All will have to be written on the same day.

Only if you have a conflicting engagement on 7th Dec, which cannot be changed or moved and you submit a request to us with proof, we will check the proofs and if found valid, we will make changes to the above allocation. Since both 7th Dec and 14th Dec are Sundays, please ensure you keep it free, especially as per the time slots given here for giving the exams.

October last week (Tentative): We will release the slots for OPPE 1 & Dates for OPPE 2 allocated for each student for their registered subjects . If eligibility is specified as part of the grading document to attend the exam and if you are eligible, exam will be scheduled as per the slots allocated.

Please choose courses for the Sep 2025 term keeping all these points in mind.

We are NOT going to have 2 OPPEs going forward. It is going to be ONE OPPE based on weeks 1-9.

Students have to mandatorily attend the OPPE on the first date.

- If you fail in this, you get a chance to reappear the next weekend. So you get 2 chances to attempt the exam.
- If the first date is inconvenient due to a clash with some other engagement, then you can apply for a postponement to the second date providing sufficient proof. If this is accepted, your exam will be moved to the second date but if you fail in this, you will not get another chance to reattempt. You will have to do it in the subsequent term.
- If you are absent on 06th Dec, you DON'T get another chance on 13th Dec..

## Timelines (Appdev1, Appdev2 & MLP, BDM projects):

Here are the timelines for students doing projects in the SEP 2025 terms who will be entering Degree level in the Jan 2026 term. Without completing the 12 courses and 4 projects, you cannot start degree level courses from Jan 2026 onwards.

For entering the Degree level in Jan 2026, you have  to complete ALL projects and vivas by December 2025. `

BDM project final submission has to be done and approved by Sep/Oct/Nov/Dec 2025 so that viva can be over in Sep/Oct/Nov/Dec 2025. Project grade for all the courses will be pushed on/beforeDec 30th.

Very important: [Viva](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT1g_NCl-ut6ET-z6nXK_UrdG2QmBOT6dNsMy0EIiho78paPDXm0-kjgot9IZC2s4ZAEKh-bC7MKWJ5/pub&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1764874104408061&usg=AOvVaw1_I4NnV6h6cS0GiYW31tP3) [policies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT1g_NCl-ut6ET-z6nXK_UrdG2QmBOT6dNsMy0EIiho78paPDXm0-kjgot9IZC2s4ZAEKh-bC7MKWJ5/pub&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1764874104408219&usg=AOvVaw2W9ADqriOAxiwEhYu3Wi5F)

Students who completed App dev1, App dev2, MLP and BDM in Sep 2021/Jan 2022 terms:

If you complete the 6 courses and 2 projects of any of the two Diplomas, you will get the Diploma certificates. But your credits will not be 27 for this Diploma but 23 or 25 depending on how many of these courses were completed in these 2 terms. The projects done as part of the courses of Sep 2021/Jan 2022 will not get the 2 credits. So there is no issue with the Diploma level.

When you come to the BSc level, 114 credits are required to obtain the BSc certificate. Hence this deficit of 2/4/6/8 credits will have to be made up by taking more elective courses offered by the IITM BS program.

# Degree Level courses

Level of the course:

The first digit of the 4 digits given in the course code represents the level of the course.

Eg: CT is CS1001 is a 1 level course.

Deep Learning CS3004 is a 3 level course.

Industry 4.0 MS4001 is a 4 level course.

BSc level:

It is now mandatory that students have to complete both the core pairs and SPG in the BSc level. Credits = 20

All remaining 8 credits can be earned from IITM BS courses or NPTEL (maximum upto 4 credits from [Table 2](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRxGnnDCVAO3KX2CGtMIcJQuDrAasVk2JHbDxkjsGrTP5ShhZK8N6ZSPX89lexKx86QPAUswSzGLsOA/pub%23h.rufxvltqqxqt:~:text%3D20K-,Table,-2%253A%2520SWAYAM%2520NPTEL&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1764874104410552&usg=AOvVaw2RPCY0lOB3xuDSYB34IKj_) ) or if there is an option to credit campus courses (IITM or other institutes), that too can be done.

BS level:

This will be implemented wef Sep 2023 for the batch that enters the degree level in Sep 2023.

2 courses in the level 4 or higher should be mandatorily completed in each of the BP and BD categories. Please refer course category in [table1](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRxGnnDCVAO3KX2CGtMIcJQuDrAasVk2JHbDxkjsGrTP5ShhZK8N6ZSPX89lexKx86QPAUswSzGLsOA/pub%23h.rufxvltqqxqt:~:text%3D45/100-,Table,-1%253A%2520Department%2520Core&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1764874104411514&usg=AOvVaw0P-x5KjulHSGpveNciBe5O)

Out of the remaining 12 c redits, it is MANDATORY to earn 4 credits in the HS/MG category. HS/MG can come from inhouse electives or from [NPTEL-Table 3](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRxGnnDCVAO3KX2CGtMIcJQuDrAasVk2JHbDxkjsGrTP5ShhZK8N6ZSPX89lexKx86QPAUswSzGLsOA/pub%23h.rufxvltqqxqt:~:text%3Dto%2520periodic%2520revision.-,Table,-3%253A%2520SWAYAM%2520NPTEL&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1764874104411978&usg=AOvVaw2wVflDLMeZicj62lGCZdi9) .

Remaining credits are from any of the other in-house/campus electives or Apprenticeship electives.
